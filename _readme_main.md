Exploration.

Use Cases:
1) Fast and easy to use project setup
2) Consistent update of already scaffolded projects to benefit from new and improved features.
3) Dummy CLI application and service demonstrating example usage of the generated directory structure and build pipeline

## Scaffolding Instructions

Step 1: Install uv package manager and copier
```shell
if [[ "$OSTYPE" == "darwin"* ]]; then                 # Install dependencies for macOS X
  if ! command -v brew &> /dev/null; then             ## Install Homebrew if not present
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
  fi
elif [[ "$OSTYPE" == "linux-gnu"* ]]; then            # Install dependencies for Linux
  sudo apt-get update -y && sudo apt-get install curl -y # Install curl
fi
if ! command -v uvx &> /dev/null; then                # Install uv package manager if not present
  curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
  source $HOME/.local/bin/env
fi
uv tool install copier                                # Install copier as global tool
```

Step 2: Now create an empty repo on GitHub and clone it to your local machine in a directory of your choice. Change to that directory.

Step 3: Scaffold the project
```shell
copier copy gh:helmut-hoffer-von-ankershoffen/oe-python-template .
```
Step 4: Setup the local environment

```shell
uv run nox -s setup_eev
```

Step 5: Perform inital commit and push
```shell
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Initial commit"
```

Visit your GitHub repository and check the Actions tab. The CI workflow should fail at the SonarQube step,
as this external service is not yet configured for our new repository.

Step 6: Follow the instructions in SERVICE_CONNECTIONS.md to setup the connections to external services
such as Cloudcov, SonarQube Cloud, Read The Docs, Docker.io, GHCR.io and Streamlit Community Cloud.

Step 7: Release the first versions
```shell
./bump
```

## Overview

Adding askhelmut to your project as a dependency is easy.

```shell
uv add askhelmut             # add dependency to your project
```

If you don't have uv installed follow [these instructions](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/). If you still prefer pip over the modern and fast package manager [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), you can install the library like this:

```shell
pip install askhelmut        # add dependency to your project
```

Executing the command line interface (CLI) is just as easy:

```shell
uvx askhelmut
```

The CLI provides extensive help:

```shell
uvx askhelmut --help              # all CLI commands
uvx askhelmut command --help      # all options for command
```

Show available commands:

```shell
uvx askhelmut --help
```

Execute commands:

uvx askhelmut echo "Lorem Ipsum"
```

### Environment

The service loads environment variables including support for .env files.

```shell
cp .env.example .env              # copy example file
echo "THE_VAR=MY_VALUE" > .env    # overwrite with your values
```

Now run the usage examples again.

### Run with Docker

You can as well run the CLI within Docker.

```shell
docker run helmuthva/askhelmut --help
docker run helmuthva/askhelmut hello-world
docker run helmuthva/askhelmut hello-world --json
docker run helmuthva/askhelmut echo "Lorem"
```

Execute command:

```shell
docker run --env THE_VAR=MY_VALUE helmuthva/askhelmut echo "Lorem Ipsum"
```

Or use docker compose

The .env is passed through from the host to the Docker container.

```shell
docker compose up
docker compose run askhelmut --help
```
